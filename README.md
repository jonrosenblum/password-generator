## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the codebase for Horiseon, a fictional marketing agency. 

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The client has requested a landing page that is optimized for search engines and follows accessibility standards.

### Work Completed

* Added and optimized the website title
* Fixed broken internal links
* Refactored HTML to make use of semantic elements
* Removed unnecessary CSS classes
* Consolidated redundant CSS selectors and properties
* Re-ordered CSS to follow HTML structure
* Added alt attributes to images
