# Password Generator

## Description

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password

- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
  WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
  WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
  WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
- THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
  WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
  WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
  WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
